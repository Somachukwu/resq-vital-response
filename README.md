> ### 🚨 A DIRECT MESSAGE TO OUR FRONTEND DESIGNER

> **A global IEEE championship is on the line, and the frontend is what wins or loses this competition.**

> Judges will not just inspect code; they will judge whether a real human being under catastrophic stress can use this product without hesitation. We are entrusting you with the visual and interaction design of ResQ. 

> 

> **We will not micromanage your layouts, dictate where every button sits, or tell you what the UI must look like.** We will give you the brand rules, the functional logic, the data contracts, and the human constraints. **We need you to bring raw, world-class design creativity and visual excellence to this build.** You have the creative freedom to design something astonishing—an interface that a frightened bystander trusts in three seconds, and an IEEE judge respects immediately. **Be fiercely creative here; a great deal is at stake.**

## 1. Core Philosophy & Design Guiding Principles




### 1.1 "As Simple As Possible, But Not Simpler"

Emergency tools must eliminate cognitive friction. Every millisecond spent searching for a button is a millisecond lost for an unresponsive victim. 

- **Remove every unnecessary complexity:** No clutter, no decorative distractions, no multi-step forms, no onboarding tutorials. The interface itself must be completely self-explanatory.

- **Do not compromise excellence for simplicity:** Simplicity does not mean ugly, barren, or amateurish. It means surgical precision, sublime typography, intuitive visual hierarchy, and instant clarity.




### 1.2 Strictly Vanilla Web Technologies (Zero Heavy Frameworks)

- **Constraint:** **Vanilla HTML5, Vanilla CSS3, and Modern Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).**

- **Strictly Prohibited:** React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, Tailwind CSS build steps, Bootstrap, or heavy JS bundles.

- **The Operational Rationale:** ResQ runs in the field in Nigeria on low-end Android smartphones, spotty 2G/3G networks, and varying screen resolutions. It must load instantly (<1.5s cold start), execute with zero bundle overhead, and maintain 60fps hardware-accelerated responsiveness without third-party hydration delays.




> 🎨 **Creative Mandate #1:** *Bring your highest visual creativity to vanilla CSS! Use modern CSS techniques—CSS Custom Properties (variables), CSS Grid, Flexbox, smooth micro-interactions, clamp() fluid typography, and subtle hardware-accelerated transitions. Prove that pure, artisan vanilla frontend code can look more modern, slick, and high-end than any bloated framework.*

## 2. Brand Identity, Design Tokens & Visual Language




### 2.1 Brand Identity

- **Product Name:** **ResQ**

- **Full Formal Title:** **ResQ — Responsive Emergency Systems Intelligence**

- **Tagline:** *"Engineering the emergency response Nigeria never had."*

- **Brand Personality:** A trauma surgeon who also teaches—decisive, trusted, calm, alive, precise, and deeply human. Never cold, never corporate, never bureaucratic, and never frantic.




### 2.2 Color Palette (Strict Quantitative Usage)




You must adhere to these exact hex values and usage proportions:




| Token Name | Hex Code | Allocation | Operational Purpose & Usage Rules |

|---|---|:---:|---|

| **ResQ Teal** | `#0D6E6E` | **50% (Primary)** | Conveys calm authority, clinical trust, safety, and life. Used on primary buttons, headers, active navigation, safe route polylines, and brand accents. |

| **ResQ Amber** | `#F0920A` | **5% (Urgent Only)** | **NEVER DECORATIVE.** Amber signals immediate attention and high priority. Used exclusively on: the SOS emergency trigger, Critical/Immediate triage badges (START Red/Yellow), active hazard flags, incident map pins, and blocked routes. |

| **ResQ Chalk** | `#F7F5F0` | **30% (Surfaces)** | Warm off-white surface that eliminates ocular fatigue under bright sunlight or high-stress situations. Used for card backgrounds, dialogs, and input containers. |

| **ResQ Ink** | `#1A1A1A` | **15% (Text & Dark)** | Near-black surface. Used for dark-mode base canvases, high-density tactical screens, body text, and data labels. Reads much softer than pure `#000000`. |

| **Deep Purple** | `#3C3489` | *Accent* | Specialized status accent for the Dispatcher GIS command layer. |

| **Coral** | `#993C1D` | *Accent* | Specialized status accent for Responder operational alerts. |

| **Neutral Grey** | `#2C2C2A` / `#4A4A48` | *Borders* | Subtle 1px dividers, card borders, and secondary controls. |

| **Muted Text** | `#9C9A92` | *Secondary* | Subtitles, metadata, timestamps, and secondary captions. |




### 2.3 Typography Direction

- **Primary Typeface:** **Inter** (Fallback: **DM Sans**, then system-ui sans-serif).

- **Allowed Font Weights:** **400 (Regular) and 500 (Medium) ONLY.**

- **Strict Rule:** **No bold (600/700/800) weights.** Bold text in crisis interfaces introduces visual aggression and anxiety. Create visual hierarchy using scale, color contrast, and spacing—not heavy font weights.

- **Text Case:** Sentence case everywhere. Avoid aggressive ALL CAPS (except for short, standardized triage badges like `RED` or `ETA`). Minimum readable font size: `12px`.




### 2.4 Iconography

- **Library:** **Tabler Icons** or **Lucide Icons** (open source).

- **Style:** Clean outline/stroke icons ONLY. Uniform stroke weight of `1.5px` at `24px` bounding box.

- **Rule:** Never use filled, cartoonish, or multi-colored decorative icons.

### 2.5 Light & Dark Theme System — Universal Implementation & Creative Mandate




Every single interface (`civilian/index.html`, `dispatcher/dashboard.html`, `responder/scene_brief.html`) **MUST feature an intuitive, instantaneous Light/Dark theme switch button.**




We are **NOT** dictating how you write the code or what the switch must look like. You have full creative license to engineer and design this feature using your own vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS mastery. However, the following operational logic and behaviors **must** be implemented seamlessly across all pages:




#### Operational Requirements:

1. **Implemented Everywhere:** Present and functional across all three portals (Civilian, Dispatcher, Responder).

2. **Context-Intelligent Defaults:**

   - **Dispatcher & Responder Portals:** Should smartly default to **Dark Mode** to preserve night vision in response vehicles and reduce eye strain in tactical control rooms, while allowing instant 1-tap switching to **Light Mode** under intense midday sunlight.

   - **Civilian Portal:** Should respect the user's operating system setting (`prefers-color-scheme`) by default, with a direct toggle available at all times.

3. **Session Persistence:** When a user switches themes, their preference must persist across page navigation, refreshes, and future sessions using native client storage (`localStorage`).

4. **Zero-Flash Performance (No FOUT):** Switching or reloading must never cause a jarring flash of white or dark content. The transition between themes must be instantaneous or silky-smooth, with zero layout shift (CLS).

5. **Ergonomic Color Harmony:**

   - **Light Mode:** Crisp surfaces built around ResQ Chalk (`#F7F5F0`) and clean white, with sharp ResQ Ink (`#1A1A1A`) text.

   - **Dark Mode:** Tactical deep surfaces built around ResQ Ink / Near-Black (`#0F1117`), with readable off-white text and soft borders.

   - In both modes, **ResQ Teal (`#0D6E6E`)** and **ResQ Amber (`#F0920A`)** must retain their vivid contrast and brand authority.




> 🎨 **Creative Mandate #5:** *Do not just slap a plain checkbox on the screen! Get genuinely creative with this theme switch. Whether you craft an elegant sun/moon SVG morph, a tactile sliding pill, a sleek ambient icon toggle, or a subtle micro-animated switch—make it feel polished, responsive, and satisfying to interact with. Its placement should be immediately discoverable without cluttering the critical emergency action areas. Show your design flair here!*

## 4. The Three Interfaces: Functional Logic & User Experience




You are responsible for designing three distinct, synchronized interfaces. **Each interface serves a different user under completely different physical conditions.**




```

   CIVILIAN PORTAL                      DISPATCHER GIS CENTER                   RESPONDER MOBILE BRIEF

(Untrained Bystander on Scene)         (Tactical Coordinator at Desk)         (Paramedic Moving in Vehicle)

┌────────────────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────────────────┐      ┌────────────────────────────┐

│ • One-tap emergency SOS    │         │ • Full-screen tactical map    │      │ • 10-second mission brief  │

│ • Plain-language AI chat   │ ──────> │ • Live multi-casualty queue   │ ───> │ • Victim count & injuries  │

│ • Step-by-step first aid   │         │ • Hospital capability layer   │      │ • Hazard & safety alerts   │

│ • Live reassurance banner  │         │ • 1-tap unit assignment       │      │ • Turn-by-turn route to ER │

└────────────────────────────┘         └───────────────────────────────┘      └────────────────────────────┘

```




---




### 4.1 Interface 1: The Civilian Mobile Portal (`templates/civilian/index.html`)




**The User:** An untrained, frightened bystander on the side of the road (e.g., the Enugu–Onitsha Expressway), holding an Android phone with shaking hands.  

**The Goal:** Guide them through life-saving first aid while silently turning their phone into an emergency sensor.




#### Functional Logic to Implement:

1. **Zero-Friction Entry:** Absolutely no sign-up, no login, no profile creation, and no lengthy multi-field forms.

2. **Prominent SOS Action:** A direct, unmistakable emergency trigger in ResQ Amber (`#F0920A`) that starts the triage session.

3. **Conversational First-Aid Stream:**

   - Bystander describes what they see in natural language (e.g., *"Two people in a crash, one is bleeding heavily and not responding"*).

   - Gemini AI responds with immediate, step-by-step first-aid guidance constrained to WHO and Nigerian Red Cross protocols (e.g., applying direct pressure, rolling into recovery position).

   - The conversation should feel calm, clear, and focused.

4. **Multimodal Sensing Inputs:**

   - Seamless button to capture/upload a scene photo (for computer vision hazard detection).

   - Audio microphone trigger for quick voice note recording (transcribed for Nigerian English/Pidgin).

   - Automatic silent capture of device GPS coordinates via `navigator.geolocation`.

5. **Dynamic Reassurance Status Banner:**

   - Once a responder is dispatched, a persistent reassurance banner must appear at the top:

     *"Help is on the way. Estimated arrival in 12 minutes. Keep doing what you are doing. We are monitoring your location."*

6. **Offline First-Aid Resilience:**

   - Cache core emergency protocols locally using `localStorage` or Service Worker so if the cellular signal drops along the expressway, the civilian can still read CPR, hemorrhage control, and shock management instructions.

7. **Direct Responder Audio/Text Trigger:**

   - A dedicated trigger allowing the civilian to speak directly with the responder once they are en route.




> 🎨 **Creative Mandate #2:** *We do not want a generic, boring chatbot window! Think deeply about how to make a mobile triage conversation feel supportive, human, and surgical. How do you design message bubbles, first-aid step cards, progress indicators, and camera buttons so someone in complete panic can tap the right control without thinking? Be exceptionally creative with tactile micro-interactions and visual breathing room.*




---




### 4.2 Interface 2: The Dispatcher GIS Command Center (`templates/dispatcher/dashboard.html`)




**The User:** An emergency dispatcher managing multiple crisis incidents simultaneously on a desktop or tablet monitor under intense time pressure.  

**The Goal:** Provide total, real-time situational awareness and enable 1-tap unit assignment without information overload.




#### Functional Logic to Implement:

1. **Full-Screen GIS Map Canvas:**

   - Integrated map (Google Maps JS API or Leaflet) with a dark tactical theme.

   - Interactive toggles for:

     - **Incident Layer:** Color-coded map markers reflecting severity (Red = Critical $\ge 4.0$, Yellow = Urgent, Green = Minor).

     - **Responder Layer:** Teal directional pins showing live responder vehicle locations and heading.

     - **Hospital Capability Layer:** Markers indicating facility specialties (Trauma center, Orthopedic, General, ICU, Blood bank).

     - **Environmental / Flood Layer:** Highlighted flood-prone river crossings and FRSC historical crash blackspots.

     - **Satellite / Hybrid Imagery:** Quick toggle for aerial remote sensing view.

2. **Real-Time Incident Triage Queue:**

   - A live, card-based incident feed sorted dynamically by the ResQ Severity Index (RSI).

   - Each card must display: Incident ID, time elapsed, victim count, suspected injuries, detected scene hazards, and triage priority badge.

3. **One-Tap Unit Dispatch Modal:**

   - Selecting an incident presents the closest qualified responder unit with pre-calculated travel time and capability match.

   - 1-tap "Dispatch Unit" button that instantly transmits the mission brief to the responder.

4. **Responder Fleet Tracker:**

   - Dedicated panel showing all registered responders, their current status (`Idle`, `Dispatched`, `En Route`, `On Scene`), and their live GPS coordinates.

5. **Two-Way Communications Console:**

   - Split-channel console allowing the dispatcher to monitor or interject into communications with both the civilian on scene and the responder unit.




> 🎨 **Creative Mandate #3:** *A tactical GIS dashboard can easily become an unreadable, cluttered mess of pins and menus. Show extreme creative mastery here! Design a clean, high-density, dark-mode command workspace inspired by premier spatial intelligence tools (like Palantir or Mapbox). Balance high information density with serene visual hierarchy. The dispatcher should be able to spot the highest-priority trauma incident in less than 500 milliseconds.*




---




### 4.3 Interface 3: The Responder Mobile Scene Brief (`templates/responder/scene_brief.html`)




**The User:** A paramedic or FRSC officer driving at 90 km/h in an emergency vehicle, reading their phone mounted on the dashboard while vibrating.  

**The Goal:** Deliver a complete, unambiguous mission brief in under 10 seconds.




#### Functional Logic to Implement:

1. **The 10-Second Mission Brief:**

   - Ultra-large, high-contrast typography readable at arm's length while moving.

   - Key vitals placed prominently:

     - **Victim Count:** (e.g., `2 VICTIMS`)

     - **Triage Level:** (e.g., `CRITICAL — RED`)

     - **Primary Suspected Trauma:** (e.g., `UNRESPONSIVE / HEAD TRAUMA`)

     - **Bystander Actions Completed:** (e.g., `Recovery position administered; bleeding compressed`)

2. **Responder Safety Alerts (High Prominence):**

   - Automated hazard warnings flagged from civilian chat or scene photos must scream for attention:

     *⚠️ "SAFETY ALERT: Fuel spill detected at collision site. Do not deploy flares."*

     *⚠️ "HAZARD: Downed high-voltage power lines across eastbound lane."*

3. **Pre-Routed Hospital Destination:**

   - Clear destination card displaying the recommended hospital based on trauma capability (e.g., *"ESUTH Parklane — Level 1 Trauma (8 mins from scene)"*), overriding closer but ill-equipped clinics.

4. **Turn-by-Turn Navigation Trigger:**

   - Quick-action button to open live Google Maps navigation directly to the incident coordinates.

5. **Background Telemetry Indicator:**

   - Visual heartbeat indicator confirming that the responder's device is broadcasting GPS coordinates every 15 seconds to the dispatcher.

6. **Direct Civilian Call / Voice Button:**

   - One-touch button to connect live audio with the bystander at the scene.




> 🎨 **Creative Mandate #4:** *Designing for a moving vehicle under sunlight is one of the hardest challenges in UI design. Contrast must be impeccable. Touch targets must be massive (minimum 56px). Text must be effortlessly legible without squinting. Be boldly creative in how you layout this mission brief so a responder absorbs the full situation in a single glance!*




---




## 5. Responsiveness, Universal Cross-Device Interoperability & Performance




> 📱💻 **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL MANDATE: EVERY INTERFACE MUST WORK ON EVERY DEVICE.**

> While our primary ergonomics are clear—**Mobile-First for Civilian & Responder**, and **Desktop/Widescreen-First for Dispatcher**—real emergencies do not wait for the ideal device!

> 

> - **The Civilian Portal** will primarily be accessed on a budget smartphone on the road, BUT if a civilian reports an urban flood or building collapse from a home laptop or desktop monitor, the layout must scale gracefully, center its reading container comfortably, and look gorgeous.

> - **The Responder Brief** is designed for a phone mount in an ambulance, BUT an incident commander or medical director on a laptop or rugged field tablet must also be able to review that same scene brief with zero distortion.

> - **The Dispatcher GIS Command Center** is designed for high-resolution desktop control rooms, BUT if a field supervisor, FRSC commander, or mobile dispatcher needs to open the dashboard from an iPad, tablet, or even an Android smartphone while in the field, **it MUST still function!** The map, incident feed, and dispatch triggers must adapt via collapsible panels, bottom sheets, or responsive drawers so a unit can still be dispatched from a phone in an emergency.

> 

> **Zero interface may crash, overflow awkwardly, or become unusable on ANY screen size.**




### 5.1 Responsive Breakpoints & Ergonomic Behavior

- **Mobile Viewports (`360px` – `600px`):**

  - Massive, tap-safe touch targets (minimum `48px` to `56px`).

  - Single-column flow with fluid spacing.

  - Dispatcher map collapses auxiliary panels into drawer toggles / bottom sheets.

- **Tablet Viewports (`601px` – `1024px`):**

  - Split-pane layouts where appropriate.

  - Dispatcher dashboard displays a side-by-side split (map on left/top, incident feed on right/bottom).

  - Civilian and responder portals comfortably padded to prevent over-stretched text lines.

- **Desktop & Widescreen Viewports (`1025px` – `1920px+`):**

  - Full-screen GIS command center with multi-column analytics, live queues, and map controls.

  - Civilian and responder flows maintain optimal reading column widths (`max-width: 540px` centered on canvas) with polished ambient surfaces.




### 5.2 Browser Compatibility

- Fully functional without degradation across all major modern mobile and desktop browsers:

  - **Google Chrome** (Android, Windows, macOS)

  - **Mozilla Firefox** (Desktop & Mobile)

  - **Apple Safari** (iOS & macOS)

  - **Microsoft Edge** (Windows)




### 5.3 Performance Budgets

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** $< 1.2$ seconds on simulated 3G network.

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** `0.00` (zero layout jumps while streaming dynamic first-aid or incident cards).

- **CSS Architecture:** Pure semantic HTML5 (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`), modern CSS variables (`:root`), fluid typography with `clamp()`, zero inline style tags.
